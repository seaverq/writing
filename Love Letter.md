I am a poet.  
You are a miracle.  
I want to write you into my poetry but no such a word could deserve you.  
  
I am the earth.  
You are the sun.  
No matter how fast I run, the path just follow you all around.  
  
I am a sailing ship.  
You are the wind.  
People amazed that I can go all around the world but they didn't notice that you are the one always behind me.  
  
You complain that there is no more love letter from me after married.  
But I never stop writing it, just write it by the time of my life with you instead of words.
