I've got a very bad memory of swimming when I was about five. Since then I just avoid everything about swimming or being in the water coz I'm afraid about it. Actually I tried once maybe two times, up to three times. But I cannot enjoy it at all. The pool full of water and my head full of fears.  
  
This year, 2014, I'm 32, it's about more than ten years since last time I was in a pool (I tell you there is a big different between swimming and being in a pool). I talked to mysefl that  
>Hey, you're not old, not at all and you never be old inside. You're just grown. But you're getting older physical. So do something really good for yourself.  
  
So I plan to build a hibit of exercise, regular exercise. I bought a running shoes but finally I found out that I'm not running people. I love fast walking more, I really do but it's so boring that walking on the treadmill and I walk to the office from home in the morning and back in the afternoon everyday anyway. It's not what I want somehow. So I thought it all over again and then back to ***Swimming***. The thing that I don't even dare to think about it. 
  
On 9th Mar, 2014, I worn my fancy life vest, just looks like a happy kid style, and I tell you, I really felt happy as I was a kid in the pool (but actually I don't know how happy it could be as a kid in the pool...). It's even surprised me. An app in my phone recorded that swimming. 30 minutes, 200 meters. That time, I was not just be in a pool, I actually can swim like everyone does. My Swimming stroke is breaststroke by the way and we call it frog style.  
  
Today, 15th Jul, 2014, it been about five months since my first swimming with my fancy life vest. But I can swimming without the life vest for a long time. Actually, I just worm the life vest for like five or six times but I spent a long time to learn how to take a breath in swimming. It was a hardest time for me but I made it!  
  
So let's see the record of today. It is 30 minutes, 1 KM.  
  
A lot of friends asked me what I really got from it, physically? Well... nothing... for now, I think it will be a long term benefit. But what I got already? I would like to say, I got more self-confidence. I feel confident when I deal with the things that I'm not sure I can achieve. And more importent thing is that ***I feel happy***.
