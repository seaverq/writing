#The thing I'm working on recently 
=======
####A novel  
In Chinese, Named *Story Teller* (temporarily).
####A Photo Album  
The pictures I took in Europe and try to write some words for each picture.

#My ides are
=======
1. do anything i can on this but not for coding
2. use Github as a writing (not coding) platform
3. Im not sure it could work like this but the idea is using collaborate function to improve my English skill (hope you guys support me on this of course). So feel free to correct my English.

#The reason Im here
=======
Maybe i have a different way to understand how it works of this website.

Coding is alway like my dream. And for sure sometimes dreams... never come true coz they are the things never come true so called DREAM.

I have a lot of ideas about design about art about website or something. BTW, my major was information management and e-commerce... its sort of something link with CODING but unfortunately i have never focused on the thing i need to focus on back to the college. Anyone did right thing when they were in college?

Back to the topic, I known this website, Github, for a while, like couple of years. I know its a heaven for coders in a way if i could say this. Today I read an article named 6 Reasons Why You’ll Never Learn to Code by Chris Castiglione. After read this, i asked myself why i stop learning code coz i really tried couple of times? Like Chris said in his article, I should stay in my motivated, but I’m not :( So I have thinking all over again and again. Well… I have ideas of a lot of fields. I known coding could help a lot on my interests. I’m fascinated about code can be transform to useful function or beautiful layout.
BUT, every time I open a coding book… damn! I don’t even want to start to read through. one of the reasons, besides I’m lazy, the most important one, is English is not my native language. I believe that my English skill is okay at least but for coding… you guys known that… well… maybe you don’t know…
Anyway, I don’t think I’m that into coding thing too much, at least for now. I want to learn some scripts, I really do. But I don’t see any reason that I need to be an expert.

Here, the community, full of smart guys; the collaborate function, make people focus on the thing they really care and willing to deal with.
Communication and Collaboration for same goal and pure interesting. This is the most important part of Github I think and I like.

#Why writing
=======
Why not? i didn’t found any reference that only allowed coding thing on this website, did you?

And for me, there is not too big difference between coding and writing. Both of them are like… write something down and whatever the result is I don’t really care about :) 

So I’m gonna give a try on this. Do something here but nothing about coding.   

#My wishes
=======
1. write something here, maybe the novel i always want to write.
2. I wish someone could join me. Tell me their stories and I will collect them.
3. interview someone here
