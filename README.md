Introduction
=======

My ides are
=======
1. do anything i can on this but not for coding
2. use Github as a writing (not coding) platform
3. Im not sure it could work like this but the idea is using collaborate function to improve my English skill (hope you guys support me on this of course). So feel free to correct my English.

The reason Im here
=======
Maybe i have a different way to understand how it works of this website.

Coding is alway like my dream. And for sure sometimes dreams... never come true coz they are the things never come true so called DREAM.

I have a lot of ideas about design about art about website or something. BTW, my major was information management and e-commerce... its sort of something link with CODING but unfortunately i have never focused on the thing i need to focus on back to the college. Anyone did right thing when they were in college?

Back to the topic, I known this website, Github, for a while, like couple of years. I know its a heaven for coders in a way if i could say this. Today I read an article named 6 Reasons Why You’ll Never Learn to Code by Chris Castiglione. After read this, i asked myself why i stop learning code coz i really tried couple of times? Like Chris said in his article, I should stay in my motivated, but I’m not :( So I have thinking all over again and again. Well… I have ideas of a lot of fields. I known coding could help a lot on my interests. I’m fascinated about code can be transform to useful function or beautiful layout.
BUT, every time I open a coding book… damn! I don’t even want to start to read through. one of the reasons, besides I’m lazy, the most important one, is English is not my native language. I believe that my English skill is okay at least but for coding… you guys known that… well… maybe you don’t know…
Anyway,

My wishes
=======
1. write something here, maybe the novel i always want to write.
2. I wish someone could join me. Tell me their stories and I will collect them.
3. interview someone here
