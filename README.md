Introduction
=======

My ides are
=======
1. do anything i can on this but not for coding
2. use github as a writing (not coding) platform
2. Im not sure it could work like this but the idea is useing collaborate function to improve my English skill (hope you guys support me on this of course).

The reason Im here
=======
Coding is alway like my dream. And for sure sometimes dreams... never come ture coz they are the things never comme ture so called DREAM.

I have a lot of ideas about design about art about website or something. BTW, my major was information management and e-commerce... its sort of something link with CODING but unfortunately i have never focused on the thing i need to focus on back to the college. Anyone did right thing when they were in college?

Back to the topic, I known this, GitHub for a while, like yesrs. I know its a heaven for coders if i could say. Today I read an aritcle named 6 Reasons Why Youâ€™ll Never Learn to Code by Chris Castiglione. After read this, i asked myself why i stop learning code coz i really tried couple of times? Like Chris said in his aritcle, I should stay in my motivied, but im not :(
